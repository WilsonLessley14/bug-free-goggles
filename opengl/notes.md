# Notes on the OpenGL Program

## 1. **Window Initialization and Context Setup**
- |initializeGL| sets up the GLFW window with OpenGL version 3.3 in core profile mode. It also ensures compatibility for macOS.
- GLAD is initialized to manage OpenGL function pointers, which is required before using OpenGL functions.
- |glViewport| defines the size and position of the rendering area. The |framebuffer_size_callback| updates the viewport when the window resizes.

---

## 2. **Shader Compilation and Program Linking**
- Shaders are written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and compiled at runtime. Vertex and fragment shaders are used to define geometry and pixel color, respectively.
- Errors during shader compilation and program linking are checked with |glGetShaderiv| and |glGetProgramiv|.
- Shaders are attached to shader programs, linked, and then deleted after linking to free resources.

---

## 3. **Vertex and Buffer Management**
- Vertex data is stored in GPU memory using Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) to optimize performance by minimizing data transfer between CPU and GPU.
- Vertex Array Objects (VAOs) encapsulate the state needed for rendering, including vertex attributes.
- Element Buffer Objects (EBOs) can be used to reuse vertex data, but in this example, they are commented out.

## 4. **Rendering Pipeline**
- Rendering involves binding the appropriate shader program and VAO, then issuing draw calls with |glDrawArrays| or similar functions.
- OpenGL's state-machine design requires binding the necessary objects and shaders before drawing and unbinding them afterward.
- The rendering loop processes input, clears the screen, and swaps buffers while polling events to ensure the application remains responsive.

---

## 5. **Memory Management and Debugging**
- OpenGL objects like shaders, VAOs, VBOs, and programs must be explicitly deleted to free GPU resources.
- Debugging involves checking shader compilation and linking logs for errors using OpenGL functions like |glGetShaderInfoLog|.
- Use |glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_LINE)| for wireframe mode to visualize geometry during debugging.
