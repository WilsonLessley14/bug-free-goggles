# Graphics Journey

## A portfolio of my projects while I self-study to become a Graphics Engineer

My goal is to get a junior/mid level graphics/rendering engine job inside of 24 months, starting May 2025.
Long term, I want to transition to physical/chemical simulations for research.

To reach my goal, I need to assume the identity of a self-taught Graphics Engineer. I am someone who studies on a consisten basis, approaches challenges with curiousity, pairs learning with making, writes about my learning, and focuses on depth, not breadth.

### Study Plan

I am commiting 1 hour every morning, before work for study, as well as a 4 hour deep study block every weekend. I may do more, but I will not do less.

Currently, I am in "Phase 1" of my journey. I am building the math and C++ foundation required for graphics engineering.

#### Active Study Objective

Linear Algebra - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

This youtube series will help build an intuitive understanding of Linear Algebra and how it will be applied to the matrix code that I will write
I will watch and take notes on the first 4 videos before moving onto Calculus Tough Up

#### Next Study Objective

Calculus Touch Up - https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity

Calculus is integral (hah) to all forms of math based computing. I will work through this course until I am comfortable with derivatives and integrals of common functions. 

#### Over-Next Study Objective

Modern C++ - https://stroustrup.com/3rd_tour.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com

C++ is the language that I will be using for Graphics Engineering projects. This book is meant as a refresher, as well as learning modern C++ practices.
